Run the application
-------------------
To run the application you will need python 2.7 and `pip` (python package manager). However, I recommend using `virtualenv` as well.

The requirements can be satisfied running this command:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't use `virtualenv` you will need root priveleges.

After the installation run:

```bash
$ python runserver.py
```

Which will start up the server on the localhost (`127.0.0.1:5000`).
